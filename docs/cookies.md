The Home Office Design System puts small files (known as ‘cookies’) on to your computer.

We use cookies to:

- record the notifications you’ve seen so we do not show them again
- measure how you use the website so it can be updated and improved based on your activity

These cookies are not used to identify you personally.

You’ll see a message on the site before we store a cookie on your computer.

### Measuring website usage with Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use the Home Office Design System. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements.

Google Analytics stores information about:

- the pages you visit
- how long you spend on each page
- how you got to the site
- what you click on while you’re visiting the site.

We do not collect or store your personal information, so this data cannot be used to identify who you are.

We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.

Google Analytics sets the following cookies:
